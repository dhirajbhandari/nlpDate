# Examples of what we want to parse:

* Various date Formats:

12-12-14 (dd-mm-yy)  UK/AU - rest of the world?
12/12/14 (dd-mm-yy)  UK/AU - rest of the world?
12-12-14 (mm-dd-yy)  US - Use the locale to disambiguate
12/12/14 (mm-dd-yy)  US - Use the locale to disambiguate

21/12/2014  (yyyy/mm/dd)
21-12-2014  (yyyy-mm-dd)

ISO format etc

* In words
 4th of July 2015
 4 Jul 2015
 Jul 4 2015
 July 1996
 Jul 96

 * Season
 Summer of '69
 Winter 50

 * Named Days
 New Year 2001

 Anchored Time (time as a distance from some other time typically current time)
 5 days ago ( - 5 days)
 now (+0)

 last year ( - 1 year)
 last month
 last week
 yesterday
 last night (- <number of hours since morning> ) :: 12-hour duration?

 next year
 next month
 next week
 tomorrow next day
 tomorrow night


 - Ideas

 * Explicit Duration
    Eg: last 10 days, in the next hour, before next week, until next year, before christmas

 * Implicit Duration - where duration is not explicitly specified but rather implied by its impreciseness
    Eg: today (24-hour ??), this afternoon (12:01 till 5:00?), tonite (from dusk till dawn)

 * Point in Time (DatePoints)

 * Formal Date/Time - various date/time formats
 * Formal Duration - From Date/Time to Date/time
 * Period (weeks days months year) - no date point implied
    4 weeks, 5 years

Plan of attack:

* First assume only date points (no durations or periods or multiple dates)
* Assume granularity
 - day (for dates like last year)
 - hour/minute (for within day like tonite, morning, evening)
